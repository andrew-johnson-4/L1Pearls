# A nontrivial parallel runtime

This runtime features a single leader process and many follower processes.
The interaction net is a great model of parallel rewriting computation.
Unfortunately interaction nets can have trouble modelling side effects of input and output.
That is where the leader process comes in to create a pseudo-sequential interface for an otherwise parallel process.
